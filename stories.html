Check this out!</h3><p>Rob had worked with some of the other members of the USA basketball team before, but this would be his first interaction with Kobe. It was so powerful, that he shared it with the world on Reddit so everyone could get a glimpse into Kobe Bryant’s insane work ethic.</p><p>‍</p><p>Here is his <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/cy27ky/an_old_post_from_a_team_usa_trainer_rob_on_reddit/">story</a>:</p><p>‍</p><p><em>&quot;In his first meeting with Kobe, Rob talked about what he specialized in, where Kobe would like to be by the end of summer, and about the hustle of his teammates. Rob then gave Kobe his number and told him to call him any time he wanted to do some extra conditioning work.</em></p><p>‍</p><p><em>Two days later, Kobe woke up Rob with a call at 4:15am in the morning.</em></p><p><em>‍</em></p><p><em>“Hey, uhh Rob, I hope I’m not disturbing anything right?”</em></p><p><em>‍</em></p><p><em>“Uhh no, what’s up Kobe?”</em></p><p><em>‍</em></p><p><em>“Just wondering if you could just help me out with some conditioning work, that’s all.”</em></p><p><em>‍</em></p><p><em>“Yeah sure, I’ll see you in the facility in a bit.”</em></p><p><em>‍</em></p><p><em>20 minutes later, Rob arrived at the training facility.

It was not even 5am yet!</em></p><p><em>‍</em></p><p><em>The two of them worked on conditioning for about 75 minutes, then did about 45 minutes of weight training. </em></p><p><em>‍</em></p><p><em>Then at 7am, Rob went back to his hotel to get some quick rest before the day’s practice. Meanwhile, Kobe went back to the gym to practice his shooting.</em></p><p><em>‍</em></p><p><em>Rob was expected back at 11am. So he slept a couple of hours, got a quick breakfast, and then headed back to the gym exhausted and sleep deprived.</em></p><p><em>‍</em></p><p><em>When he arrived, he saw all of the members of Team USA there. Lebron was talking to Carmelo, Coach Krzyzewski was explaining something to Kevin Durant and, on the right side of the facility all by himself, Kobe was shooting jumpers.</em></p><p><em>‍</em></p><p><em>Rob went up to Kobe and said, “Good work this morning.”</em></p><p><em>‍</em></p><p><em>“Huh?”</em></p><p><em>‍</em></p><p><em>“Like, the conditioning.

Ever since he first heard it last July, he’s been obsessed with it.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p><em>“The first night we all got into Las Vegas last summer for the USA Basketball camp, I heard Kobe went on some 40-mile bike ride at night through the desert,” Griffin says. “Forty miles? At night? You think it’s true?”</em></p><p>‍</p><p><em>Before I can answer, Griffin continues:</em></p><p>‍</p><p><em>“When I found out about that bike ride, I was so tempted to ask him if I could go next time.”</em></p><p><em>This is my favorite part about Kobe: you assume this story is true. Forty miles in the desert? You don’t even question it.</em></p><p>‍</p><p><em>…in this moment, all Griffin wants to talk about is whether or not Kobe Bryant really got on a bike and rode 40 miles through the desert last July.</em></p><p>‍</p><p><em>“I love that stuff,” Griffin says. “I love all those stories.”</em></p><p>‍</p><p>The story Griffin heard turns out to be true. And it goes something like this: Bryant told his longtime trainer, Tim Grover, that he wanted to add in bike training to his summer conditioning. Grover researched a trail in Las Vegas, rented three bikes — one for Bryant, one for himself and one for Bryant’s security guard — and on the night before the first day of practice, they each put on headlamps and headed out to the trail and rode.</p><p>‍</p><p><em>“We finished up around 2 a.m.” Grover said. “And we were back in the gym working out by 7:30 in the morning.”</em></p><p>‍</p><blockquote><em>And that’s just it. To Blake Griffin, and most of the NBA, these are just stories.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>To Kobe Bryant, that’s a Tuesday night.</em><br/></blockquote></div><div class="divider"></div></div><div id="Drive-to-Win" class="story"><h1 class="heading-h4 story-title">On his drive to win</h1><div class="story-description w-richtext"><h3>Losing? What&#x27;s that?</h3><p>“The thing that makes him so unstoppable is that he never stops coming. This year we were up in New Orleans by like 12 in the 4th quarter with 5-6 minutes left, and we pretty much had the game in control. And (Kobe) was there on the free throw line and he was like ‘You know I ain’t going to let us lose right?’, and I looked back at him and I was like ‘What!? Man I ain’t letting my team lose!’. And he was like ‘Alright but I just know I ain’t going to let my team lose.’ And I went back at him ‘Well I ain’t going to let my team lose!’</p><p>‍</p><p>“Right after that, man… he ran off like 15 straight points on us. And I was looking at the scoreboard going ‘Come on, let the time run down’, and I’m like he can’t beat us single-handedly especially after I was just sitting there talking crap back and forth to him.</p><p>‍</p><p>“We ended up winning the game, but he almost beat us!

He averaged a then career-high (by a tick) 15.5 points and then career-high 5.8 rebounds. His free throw shooting improved, too.</p><p>‍</p><p><em>&quot;Work ethic,&quot;</em> Butler said. <em>&quot;He comes to the gym 6:30, 7 in the morning, gets shots every day, a rhythm. Afterward hits the weight room, works out in the summer, studying film, critiquing guys, watching their tendencies, picking things up ...

It&#x27;s business.&quot;</em></p><div class="w-embed"><hr></div><h3><strong>Kevin Durant</strong></h3><p>We had the day off, but they said we could get some shots up if we wanted, so I decided to head over to the gym with [Oklahoma City teammate] Jeff Green.</p><p>‍</p><p><em>&quot;Kobe [Bryant] was the only guy on the bus to the gym, and that spoke volumes to me -- he&#x27;s the best player in the game, yet he&#x27;s always willing to come work on his game, so that kind of motivated me and Jeff,&quot;</em> Durant said. </p><p>‍</p><p><em>&quot;He went by himself, he got a lot of shots up, and by the time he was done you could see he had gotten better over that hour.

In a game against the Wizards, Kobe broke the wrist on his shooting hand. He was always the first person to practice every day, arriving at least an hour and a half early. </p><p>‍</p><p>This would infuriate me because I wanted to be the first person to practice, just as I had always been at Villanova and Piscataway High in New Jersey. To add insult to injury, I lived only 10 minutes from the practice facility — while Kobe was at least 35 minutes away.</p><p>‍</p><p><em>“I am ashamed to say that I was excited the day after his injury because I knew that there was no way that №8 (as former Laker point guard Tyronn Lue called him) would be the first to practice, if he would even be there at all.</em></p><p><em>‍</em></p><p><em>As I walked through the training room, I became stricken with fear when I heard a ball bouncing. No, no, it couldn’t be! Yes it could. Kobe was already in a full sweat with a cast on his right arm and dribbling and shooting with his left.”</em></p><div class="w-embed"><hr></div><h3><em>‍</em>Laron Profit<strong><br/></strong></h3><p><em>“You know it was so funny, my first experience when I was out in LA, me and Kwame Brown got traded to the Lakers [in Summer of 2005]. We were playing a pick-up game before the season started, we were playing 3-on-3, and it was game point.</em></p><p><em>‍</em></p><p><em>“Kobe had the ball and it came off, Kwame knocked the ball away from him.</em></p><p><em>‍</em></p><p><em>“Again [this was] a pick-up game, September, nothing on the line. And the ball rolled to half court.</em></p><p><em>‍</em></p><p><em>“Kobe then ran to half-court, dived under Kwame’s legs with the ball for about 10 feet, picked the ball up, came back down, made some incredible move, then hit the game-winning shot to end the pick-up game.</em></p><p><em>‍</em></p><p><em>“I walked off the court, and I called my mom, and I said, “I think I’ve just seen the second best player ever [behind Jordan].”</em></p><p><em>‍</em></p><p><em>“But then around him, you understand that nothing he does is by accident, that all this is a result of hours and hours and hours of preparation. So that when he gets into a situation in a game, in a playoffs game, in a Finals game, his confidence comes from his preparation.</em></p><p><em>‍</em></p><p><em>“He once told me at a halftime of a game, he was struggling, I think we were playing Seattle [Sonics] and he was struggling, and I asked him, “How do you feel?” and he said, “I feel great! The second half… the second half. Hey Prof, I work too hard. These shots HAVE to fall eventually because I’ve worked too hard, I’ve shot too many shots.”</em></p><p><em>‍</em></p><p><em>“So his belief in himself… when we look at it and see it as arrogance, some people see as may have too much confidence. It’s really just a result of how hard he works, of how much preparation time he puts in his game. That once he steps on the court, he really believes that he will be successful. And that’s what I think I took away from him more than anything else, it’s that your belief in yourself has to come from your confidence and your preparation.&quot;</em></p><div class="w-embed"><hr></div><h3><strong>Chris Douglas-Roberts<br/></strong></h3><p>A lot of people wondered why Bean spoke so highly of me last yr. </p><p>‍</p><p>First day of camp Mike Brown tried to throw me in the fire right away.

He believed he could accomplish anything. This is the basic belief of many successful professional athletes. The great ones, however, seem to have a deeper and profound belief in themselves. A belief that can propel them to higher elevations that other surrounding believers never reach.<br/><br/>I would join the “kid” on the Lakers in 1999 when I was drafted as the No. 30 overall pick by the organization. I had followed Kobe on television for three years prior to joining the team. But TV could not illustrate how Kobe made himself. </p><p>‍</p><p>Only viewing him in person, right there in the practice facility in El Segundo, could a person get an accurate gauge. There was a reason for his greatness. There was a reason for his cockiness. Kobe prepared, he worked, he prepared and he worked again.<br/><br/>The first time I began to understand why he was the best was in the pre-season. In a game against the Wizards, Kobe broke the wrist on his shooting hand. He was always the first person to practice every day, arriving at least an hour and a half early. </p><p>‍</p><p>This would infuriate me because I wanted to be the first person to practice, just as I had always been at Villanova and Piscataway High in New Jersey. To add insult to injury, I lived only 10 minutes from the practice facility -- while Kobe was at least 35 minutes away.<br/><br/>I am ashamed to say that I was excited the day after his injury because I knew that there was no way that No. 8 (as former Laker point guard Tyronn Lue called him) would be the first to practice, if he would even be there at all.<br/><br/>As I walked through the training room, I became stricken with fear when I heard a ball bouncing. No, no, it couldn’t be! Yes it could. Kobe was already in a full sweat with a cast on his right arm and dribbling and shooting with his left.<br/><br/>As the next couple of days of practice passed, I would glance over as Phil Jackson was talking and see Kobe on the side going full speed and pulling up with his left. He was a conducting an all-out practice with himself. Lakers trainer Gary Viti, had to come in and tell Kobe to take a rest. But when Viti left, Kobe was at it again.<br/><br/>One day I was shooting on a side basket -- on the court that Kobe had made his own practice spot. He challenged me.<br/><br/><em>“Cele, let’s shoot,&quot; he said. &quot;Wanna play H-O-R-S-E?”</em><br/><br/>I laughed at him. I was actually insulted that he would challenge me, a pro, to a game of horse with his left hand. After he insisted, I figured I would just whip him and prove to him that he wasn’t Superman. He couldn’t do everything.<br/><br/>He made shot after shot after shot. I was beginning to feel more pressure as I got each letter. First H, then O, then R, then S. I couldn’t let this man beat me with a broken shooting hand. </p><p>‍</p><p>My gosh, he was shooting threes with his left. I finally made a deep three and the stars aligned and Kobe missed. I had escaped the most embarrassing moment of my basketball life. When he missed he was infuriated.<br/><br/><em>“Come on Cele, let’s play again,”</em> Kobe insisted<br/><br/>He really thought he could win and he almost did. He really thought he was Superman. He really thought I would put myself in another situation to lose all of my dignity. I laughed at him again<br/><br/><em>“Maybe later,”</em> I replied.<br/><br/>When Kobe&#x27;s wrist healed and he came back during the regular season, he again proved to me that he believed he could do anything. During his first game back, Kobe drove left and pulled up for a jumper. It was an airball. He shot it with his left. </p><p>‍</p><blockquote>The result didn’t matter. The fact he attempted the shot astounded me. In an NBA game in front of thousands, the man shot a left-handed jumper. He believed it would go in. He really believed.<br/>‍</blockquote><p>Today, five years later, nothing I see from or about No. 8 surprises me. It didn’t surprise me that he thought he could win without Shaquille O&#x27;Neal. It didn’t surprise me that he didn’t succeed. </p><p>‍</p><p>It won’t surprise if he comes back and succeeds this year. It didn’t surprise me that he could go to Colorado, sit in court, fly to Denver and drop game-winning shot all on the same day. It doesn’t surprise me that Kobe is averaging 36.5 points per game. It won’t surprise me if he leads the league in scoring.<br/><br/>I called my old roommate, Howard Brown, long distance over in Spain where he is playing professionally. We talked about life, we talked about old times. We talked about Kobe leading the league in scoring.<br/><br/>We both agreed Kobe’s game is no joke and we ain’t laughing no more.</p><p><br/></p><p><a href="http://awbutler.blogspot.com/2008/03/why-kobe-bryant-inspires-me.html">Source</a></p><div class="w-embed"><hr></div><h3>Wade and Heat forward Chris Bosh for their defining Bryant moments</h3><p><em>&quot;No matter what he&#x27;s done, no matter how many championships he&#x27;s won, he&#x27;s still the most competitive guy in the gym,&quot;</em> Wade said of Bryant. </p><p>‍</p><p><em>&quot;It&#x27;s something I want to emulate.
